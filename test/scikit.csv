"Logistic regression classifier has different solvers and one of them is 'sgd'

It also has a different classifier 'SGDClassifier' and the loss parameter can be mentioned as 'log' for logistic regression.

Are they essentially the same or different? If they are different, how different is the implementation between two? And how do you decide which one to use given the problem of logistic regression?
","Algorithm:

Logistic Regression ('sag'/'saga'): Solves the optimization problem using averaged stochastic gradient methods.
SGDClassifier: Uses plain stochastic gradient descent with flexible settings.
Use Case:

Logistic Regression: Suitable for small to medium datasets or when higher precision is needed.
SGDClassifier: Better for very large datasets due to its efficiency in online learning.",Logistic Regression with 'sag'/'saga' solvers and SGDClassifier with loss='log' are different. Both perform logistic regression but use distinct optimization techniques.
"How gaussian mixture models work?

I am given an example:

Suppose 1000 observations are drawn from N(0,1) and N(5,2) with mixing parameters ?1=0.2 and ?2=0.8 respectively. Suppose we only know ? and want to estimate ? and ?. How does one go about using Gaussian Mixture models to estimate these parameters? I know I have to use the EM algorithm but I do not know where to start. I want to use this simple example to get a better understanding of how it works.","For your example:
Given: Two normal distributions,  ??(0,1)and ??(5,2), with mixing parameters  ??1 =0.2 and ??2=0.8. Only variances (?? 2) are known.
Goal: Estimate 
??1,??2(means) and  ??1,??2 (mixing weights).
Steps:
Initialize  ??1,??2 and ??1,??2
?randomly or heuristically.
Perform the E-step to compute posterior probabilities of each data point belonging to each Gaussian component.
Update ?? and  ?? in the M-step using the soft assignments from the E-step.
Iterate until convergence (e.g., log-likelihood stabilizes).
This iterative process ensures maximum likelihood estimation of ?? and ??","Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) estimate parameters (e.g., means, mixing weights) using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which alternates between two steps: 1. E-Step (Expectation): Compute the probability of each observation belonging to each component (soft assignments) using the current parameters.  2. M-Step (Maximization): Update the parameters (means, mixing coefficients, etc.) to maximize the likelihood based on these probabilities."
I'm working in a sklearn homework and I don't understand why one should standardize and normalize the test data with the training mean and sd. How can I implement this in Python?,"When preprocessing:

Training set: Compute the mean and standard deviation.
Test set: Use the same mean and standard deviation from the training set to standardize the test data.
This avoids using future information (test set stats) during model training, which could lead to overfitting.","Standardizing and normalizing the test data with the training mean and standard deviation ensures consistency between training and test datasets. This prevents data leakage from the test set into the training process, allowing the model to generalize better to unseen data.

"I have a collection of very large images. I tesselated these images into patches and computed feature embeddings via a pretrained ResNet for each patch in each image. The mean number of patches is 15000 with a feature dimension of 1024.

I would like to apply spectral clustering to this dataset, clustering each image, now of shape [15000, 1024], individually.

This seems to be computationally very expensive, taking roughly 15 minutes per image. I read about the combination of Nystroem approximation with (or within?) Spectral Clustering. But I can not figure out how to combine them in scikit-learn.","Spectral clustering involves creating a similarity matrix (kernel) and performing eigen decomposition, which is computationally expensive for large datasets. The Nystroem method approximates the similarity matrix using a subset of the data, reducing computational complexity while maintaining reasonable accuracy.","The Nystroem approximation can significantly reduce the computational cost of spectral clustering by approximating the kernel matrix. In Scikit-learn, you can use the Nystroem class to approximate the kernel and then use the resulting feature space with a clustering algorithm like KMeans."
how does sklearn's gaussian mixture model avoid numerical overflow errors with so many multiplications?,"When working with Gaussian Mixture Models, computing the likelihood involves multiplying many small probability values (from the Gaussian densities), which can lead to numerical underflow. The log-sum-exp trick calculates logarithms of these probabilities and performs addition in log-space, thereby avoiding overflow or underflow issues.","Scikit-learn's Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) avoids numerical overflow errors by operating in the log-space when computing probabilities. Specifically, the library uses the log-sum-exp trick, which ensures numerical stability by preventing excessively large or small values during the multiplication of probabilities."
"Procedure for selecting optimal number of features with Python's Scikit-Learn

I have a dataset with 130 features (1000 rows) . I want to select the best features for my classifier. I started with RFE but Its taking too long, i done this:
number_of_columns = 130 for i in range(1, number_of_columns): rfe = RFE(model, i) fit = rfe.fit(x_train, y_train) acc = fit.score(x_test, y_test
Because this took to long, I changed my approach, and I want to see what you think about it, is it good / correct approach.
First I did PCA, and I found out that each column participates with around 1-0.4%, except last 9 columns. Last 9 columns participate with less than 0.00001% so I removed them. Now I have 121 features.
pca = PCA()
fit = pca.fit(x)
Then I split my data into train and test (with 121 features).
Then I used SelectFromModel, and I tested it with 4 different classifiers. Each classifier in SelectFromModel reduced the number of columns. I chosed the number of column that was determined by classifier that gave me the best accuracy:
model = SelectFromModel(clf, prefit=True) #train_score = clf.score(x_train, y_train) test_score = clf.score(x_test, y_test) column_res = model.transform(x_train).shape
End finally I used 'RFE'. I have used number of columns that i get with 'SelectFromModel'.
rfe = RFE(model, number_of_columns) fit = rfe.fit(x_train, y_train) acc = fit.score(x_test, y_test)
Is this a good approach, or I did something wrong?
Also, If I got the biggest accuracy in SelectFromModel with one classifier, do I need to use the same classifier in RFE?","The response is based on the general understanding of dimensionality reduction, feature selection techniques like RFE and SelectFromModel, and classifier feature importance. The feedback addresses the need for efficient and focused feature selection, optimizing for computational cost, and ensuring the feature selection process aligns with your model's goal.","The approach of using PCA, SelectFromModel, and then RFE is generally valid, but it could be more streamlined. PCA focuses on variance, not classification power, which can lead to unnecessary feature removal. Instead, you could use SelectFromModel directly, followed by RFE, but with careful attention to the computational cost and feature redundancy. Consistency in classifiers between SelectFromModel and RFE is not mandatory, but it can help."
"I have trained a classifier on 'Rocks and Mines' dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/undocumented/connectionist-bench/sonar/sonar.all-data) And when calculating the accuracy score it always seems to be perfectly accurate (output is 1.0) which I find hard to believe. Am I making any mistakes, or naive bayes is this powerful?","This answer is based on the understanding of common issues with overfitting, data leakage, and cross-validation in machine learning. The advice aligns with standard best practices in training and evaluating models. Checking the train-test split and using cross-validation should help avoid these issues.","It is likely that your model is overfitting or that there is a mistake in your data split, leading to perfect accuracy. A common issue could be that the model is trained and tested on the same data, which would lead to perfect accuracy. Naive Bayes itself, while simple and effective, is unlikely to give perfect results unless the dataset is trivially separable or there is a data leakage."
After reading sklearn manual it was not very obvious for me to understand how Isotonic regression works in the case of probability calibration (using CalibratedClassifierCV).,This explanation is based on the CalibratedClassifierCV documentation and the concept of isotonic regression for probability calibration in scikit-learn. Isotonic regression is a form of non-parametric regression which works well when you have enough calibration data to avoid overfitting.,"Isotonic regression in the context of probability calibration works by fitting a piecewise constant, non-decreasing function to the predicted probabilities. It maps the predicted probabilities to calibrated probabilities based on the training data. For example, if the model predicts a probability of 0.8, isotonic regression will map that value to a more accurate probability based on the calibration data. It is useful when the model's predicted probabilities are skewed, and the calibration data is large enough to avoid overfitting."
"How do you choose the feature selection algorithm(s) from scikit learn?
When should each be considered? Which are considered to be the most generally reliable? I am fairly new to ML and am having trouble understanding how to decide which feature selection method(s) to use for any given task.
","Based on scikit-learn’s feature selection methods. Choose based on model type, task complexity, and dataset size.","Feature selection depends on the dataset and model:

Univariate Selection (SelectKBest): Use when quickly selecting features based on statistical tests. Best for smaller datasets.
RFE: Recursively eliminates less important features, useful for models like decision trees and logistic regression.
L1 Regularization (Lasso): Shrinks less important features to zero. Ideal for sparse datasets with many irrelevant features.
Tree-based (SelectFromModel): Uses feature importance from models like decision trees or random forests. Effective for complex datasets."
"I have a dataset of images that I would like to run nonlinear dimensionality reduction on. To decide what number of output dimensions to use, I need to be able to find the retained variance (or explained variance, I believe they are similar). Scikit-learn seems to have by far the best selection of manifold learning algorithms, but I can't see any way of getting a retained variance statistic. Is there a part of the scikit-learn API that I'm missing, or simple way to calculate the retained variance?","In scikit-learn, PCA is commonly used for measuring explained variance. For non-linear methods, you may not directly get a retained variance measure, but you can explore other ways of validating your dimensionality reduction, like checking for reconstruction error or other metrics like cross-validation for downstream tasks.","In scikit-learn, non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms (like Isomap, LocallyLinearEmbedding, t-SNE, etc.) do not directly provide a ""retained variance"" metric, as these algorithms are not linear and do not rely on variance as a performance measure like PCA does. However, if you are using Isomap or LocallyLinearEmbedding, you can estimate the ""explained variance"" in a more indirect way by comparing the distances before and after dimensionality reduction."
"Does running a Decision Tree classifier several times help?
To introduce, I am a novice in ML techniques. I recently had to write a scikit-learn based decision tree classifier to train on a real dataset. Someone suggested me that I must run mu model several thousand times and plot the accuracies on a graph. Here's the rub: I manually ran it around 20 -30 times and every time it gave the same accuracy (for both gini and entropy base). Is that wrong? Should it show slight variations every time?","If you want variations in the results, try running the classifier with different random_state values or using ensemble methods like Random Forests, which average over many trees trained with different random subsets of the data. In your case, seeing the same accuracy for both Gini and entropy is expected, unless there's randomness involved.","Running a Decision Tree classifier multiple times on the same dataset should, in general, yield slightly different results if the model is using randomness, such as when the max_depth, min_samples_split, or random_state parameters are set in a non-deterministic way. If you are using default parameters (e.g., random_state=None) and the same dataset, the Decision Tree will likely give the same result each time. This happens because the tree-building process is deterministic without explicit randomness."
"I am building a classification model for Iris flower classification by using Logistic Regression.

After these steps, you should be able to import and use LogisticRegression without errors.",The ImportError you're encountering typically happens due to an issue with the scikit-learn installation or the environment configuration. The LogisticRegression class should be available in sklearn.linear_model if scikit-learn is correctly installed.
Do you know if models from scikit-learn use automatically multithreading or just sequential instructions?,"However, many scikit-learn models allow parallelization by setting the n_jobs parameter, which controls the number of CPU cores used for parallel computations. For example:
In tree-based models (e.g., RandomForest, GradientBoosting), setting n_jobs=-1 will use all available CPU cores. In cross-validation (e.g., cross_val_score), you can set n_jobs=-1 to parallelize the process across available cores.
For most other models, including linear models like Logistic Regression, multithreading is not automatic. You can enable parallelism manually in some cases, but many models, like SVMs and logistic regression, operate sequentially by default. In summary, for automatic parallelization, you need to check the specific model's documentation for parallelization options and use the n_jobs parameter accordingly.",Scikit-learn models do not automatically use multithreading for most algorithms. They typically operate sequentially unless explicitly told to use parallelization.
"I'm working on a classification problem with unbalanced classes (5% 1's). I want to predict the class, not the probability.
In a binary classification problem, is scikit's classifier.predict() using 0.5 by default? If it doesn't, what's the default method? If it does, how do I change it?
In scikit some classifiers have the class_weight='auto' option, but not all do. With class_weight='auto', would .predict() use the actual population proportion as a threshold?
What would be the way to do this in a classifier like MultinomialNB that doesn't support class_weight? Other than using predict_proba() and then calculation the classes myself",Scikit-learn’s default classification relies on a fixed threshold unless you adjust it manually. Use metrics like PR-AUC or ROC-AUC to determine the best threshold for imbalanced datasets. ,"Default Threshold: predict() uses a 0.5 threshold by default in scikit-learn for binary classification.
Change Threshold: Use predict_proba() and set a custom threshold:
y_pred = (model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1] > threshold).astype(int)
class_weight='balanced': This adjusts training weights for imbalanced data but doesn’t affect the 0.5 threshold used in predict().
Handling Imbalance (e.g., MultinomialNB):
Resample data.

Is it possible to use scikit-learn to return multiple results? Or even return the label with the next highest probability?","Scikit-learn classifiers are generally designed for single-label prediction. For multi-label tasks, specific approaches (like OneVsRestClassifier) and manual adjustments (thresholding or ranking) are needed.","Multi-label Classification: Use MultiLabelBinarizer to handle multiple labels and train your model accordingly.

TensorFlow, in contrast, supports GPU acceleration, particularly for deep learning tasks, enabling more efficient training on large datasets. The documentation emphasizes TensorFlow's flexibility for low-level algorithm implementation, while Scikit-learn provides off-the-shelf, easy-to-use algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.","Scikit-learn and TensorFlow serve different purposes:

Scikit-learn is optimized for classical machine learning tasks (e.g., SVMs, Random Forests, Logistic Regression). It is simpler and requires less boilerplate but does not leverage GPU acceleration for most algorithms.
